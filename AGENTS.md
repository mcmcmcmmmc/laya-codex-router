# AGENTS.md — autonomous install & operations playbook

This file lets a coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, …) install, verify
and operate the **Laya Codex Router** on a user's machine without asking for
context it can discover itself. Follow it top to bottom. Do not skip the
verification step after each stage — they are what makes autonomy safe here.

## What you are installing

A local server plus a Codex Router extension that adds one model to the Codex
picker — **"Laya Codex Router"** (`jev/auto`, retained as a compatibility
slug). Every turn sent to it is classified locally by
[Laya](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya) and served by the selected native
Codex model at an adapted thinking depth. All traffic stays on loopback; the
design is fail-open; there is a kill switch. The original Jev decision backend
remains optional and is not needed for the default installation.

## Hard rules (never violate)

1. **Never print, log, commit, or transmit secrets** — the optional TypeSafe
   API key, the router `caller-secret`, or ChatGPT tokens. Reference them by
   file path.
2. **Edit the source, never the artifact.** `<router checkout>/src/` is the
   router's own source and is meant to be edited: a behaviour bug is fixed
   there, committed on the checkout's branch, with the tests that cover it.
   What is off limits is the *generated and managed* output — `litellm.yaml`
   under the router's state directory is rendered from `src/litellm-config.mjs`
   whenever the catalog changes, and the `codex-router-managed` blocks of
   `~/.codex/config.toml` are written by the CLI, so a hand edit there is
   overwritten rather than applied. Change the generator, or drive the CLI and
   the documented state files (`user-models.json`, `generic-providers.json`),
   and leave the artifacts to be regenerated.
3. The server binds `127.0.0.1` only. Never expose it on another interface.
4. If `launchctl` is restricted in your environment (supervised agents often),
   skip the service install — use the watchdog pattern and let the user run
   `server/install-service.sh` from their own Terminal instead. Never fight
   the restriction.
5. Treat prompt excerpts in local logs (`jev-router-live.jsonl`,
   `shadow-log.jsonl`) as private user data: read locally, never republish.

## Prerequisites (check, and report what you found)

- **macOS** with **Codex** and a **Codex Router installation** (the local router
  that serves native GPT models to Codex on `127.0.0.1:4202`).
  Check: `<router checkout>/bin/codex-router status` → expect
  `{"state":"running"}`; `./bin/codex-router providers generic list` must exist.
- **Python ≥ 3.11** — `python3 -V`.
- Network access during installation to clone Laya and download its public
  multilingual checkpoint. Inference is local after the checkpoint is cached.
- A **TypeSafe API key is not required** for the default Laya backend. It is
  needed only if the user deliberately selects the optional `jev` backend.

## Install, step by step

### 1 — Install Laya and its public checkpoint

```bash
cd <repo>
bash server/install-laya-runtime.sh
printf 'laya\n' > ~/.codex/codex-router/decision-backend
```

The script creates or reuses the sibling checkout `<repo>/../laya`, installs it
into `<repo>/../laya/.venv`, downloads only the multilingual checkpoint, and
runs a local prediction. It never reads or prints Codex or ChatGPT credentials.
Set `LAYA_ROOT` or `LAYA_MODEL_PATH` only when using a different layout.

### 2 — Start the server

```bash
cd <repo>
../laya/.venv/bin/python server/jev_server.py &  # long-lived; launchd in step 7
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4319/health      # expect: {"ok": true, "service": "jev-router"}
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4319/v1/models   # expect: one model, id "auto"
```

The health response must include `"decision_backend":"laya"`.

### 3 — Declare the model

Create `~/.codex/codex-router/user-models.json` (hand-editable state file; if
it already has `models`, append to the array instead of overwriting):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "models": [
    {
      "slug": "jev/auto",
      "gatewayModel": "jev-auto",
      "compHash": "jev-auto-user-v1",
      "upstreamModel": "auto",
      "provider": "jev",
      "listed": true,
      "displayName": "Laya Codex Router",
      "description": "Local routing by Laya: every turn is classified and served by luna, sol or astra at the thinking depth it needs.",
      "priority": 95,
      "defaultEffort": "medium",
      "reasoningLevels": [
        {"effort": "low", "description": "Quick reasoning"},
        {"effort": "medium", "description": "Balanced reasoning"},
        {"effort": "high", "description": "Deep reasoning"},
        {"effort": "xhigh", "description": "Extended reasoning"},
        {"effort": "max", "description": "Maximum reasoning"}
      ],
      "contextWindow": 258400,
      "autoCompact": 219640,
      "inputModalities": ["text", "image"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4 — Register the generic provider (router CLI)

```bash
cd <router checkout>
./bin/codex-router providers generic add jev --name "Laya Router" \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:4319/v1 --adapter openai-responses --allow-private
./bin/codex-router providers generic list
# expect:  SHOW jev   Laya Router (openai-responses)
```

### 5 — Share native ChatGPT access with local clients

```bash
./bin/codex-router chatgpt-session enable
# expect: "enabled for this user's local Codex Router clients (session valid
# for about NNNh)". Re-run this when native calls later return Unauthorized.
```

### 6 — Publish and show

```bash
./bin/codex-router refresh-catalog        # merged catalog must now contain "jev/auto"
./bin/control picker set jev/auto show    # returns the picker JSON with jev/auto visible
```

### 7 — Persistent service (optional)

Ask the user to run, in **their own Terminal**:

```bash
bash <repo>/server/install-service.sh     # launchd service, keep-alive, logs in ~/Library/Logs
```

Alternative (any scheduler, every 5 min): `<repo>/server/watchdog.sh` —
silent when healthy, restarts the server when down.

### 8 — Restart Codex

Fully quit and reopen the Codex app so it reloads the picker catalog, then the
user can select **Laya Codex Router**.

## End-to-end verification (must pass before declaring success)

```bash
SEC=$(cat ~/.codex/codex-router/caller-secret | tr -d '\n')
curl -s -N -m 120 -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:4202/_codex-router/$SEC/v1/responses" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"jev/auto","input":[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"Say OK"}]}],"stream":true}' | head -c 400
```

Expect an SSE stream ending with `response.completed` and `data: [DONE]`. The
selected model depends on Laya's decision and is not asserted in advance. Then:

```bash
tail -1 ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl
# expect one JSON line: gate=apply, tier, conf, depth, model, effort, speed,
# decision_backend=laya, decision_ms, total_ms, status=200, out=sse
```

## Operations

- **Decision log**: `~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl` — one line per
  routed turn.
- **Ask surface**: `POST /ask` (also `/v1/ask`) — typed decisions from the
  selected backend for local callers with their own question set (state ≤ 120k
  chars, ≤ 40 questions, caller state never logged). With the optional Jev
  backend, `502 jev: HTTP Error 402` means the TypeSafe account is out of
  credits and `503` means no key was found.
- **Kill switch** (instant, no restart): `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.off`
  → the server relays to astra without calling the decision backend. Remove the
  file to re-enable.
- **Codex-dry tandem** (only while native usage is exhausted):
  `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.codex-dry` → frontier-tier calls go to
  `opencode-go/glm-5.3-flash`, every other tier to
  `opencode-go/deepseek-v4.1-flash`; remove the file to return to the
  luna/sol/astra triptych. An automatic flip (429 / usage-limit response) also
  retries the failed call on the tandem, then lasts until the instant the edge
  announced for the window reset (30 minutes when the refusal announces none,
  one week at most) — `cat ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.codex-dry.json`
  reads the reason and `until_iso` — and is cleared by the next successful
  native call. Log fields to watch: `dry`, `native`, `retried`.
- **Thread display**: streamed reasoning summaries get the routed tag appended
  in place ( · 🧠sol:low · , separators on both sides so the next summary part
  never glues to the tag; one glyph per route — ⚡luna, 🧠sol, 🚀astra,
  🐳deepseek/✨glm in tandem) — the picked model shows inside each call's thinking
  block in the Codex thread.
- **Shadow mode**: `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.shadow` → decisions
  are logged (`would` field) while every call is still served by astra.
- **Debug capture** (bounded): `touch ~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router.debug`
  → request shapes in `jev-router-debug.jsonl` and raw response streams in
  `jev-router-debug-stream.log`. Remove the file to stop.
- **Tune the policy**: the shared contract in `server/routing_policy.py`. Keep decisions
  joint and evidence-based; restart the server after edits.
- **Backtest**: `python3 poc/backtest_savings.py --days 7` (see BACKTEST.md).
- **Disable**: `./bin/codex-router providers generic disable jev` (keeps state);
  full rollback: also `./bin/codex-router chatgpt-session disable` and stop the
  service (`launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.thibaultsaintjean.jev-router`).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `{"detail":"Unauthorized"}` from the caller edge | native sharing off | `./bin/codex-router chatgpt-session enable` |
| `{"detail":"Stream must be set to true"}` | the caller edge streams only | send `"stream": true`; the bundled server forces it |
| HTTP 502 `provider_api_proxy_error` on jev-auto | server-side error | check the `status`/`out` fields in `jev-router-live.jsonl`, and the server's stderr log |
| "Laya Codex Router" absent from the picker | not published/visible, or Codex not restarted | `refresh-catalog`, `control picker set jev/auto show`, full Codex restart |
| Native 429 / "usage limit" while routing | ChatGPT usage window exhausted | expected: the Codex-dry tandem takes over (`jev-router.codex-dry.json`); delete the manual file to re-probe sooner |
| Jev calls fail with `402 Payment Required` (`gate=codex_dry(fallback)`, `tier` null in the log) | the TypeSafe account is out of credits | expected: the router keeps serving through the tandem; add credits at console.typesafe.ai to restore classification |
| `Unknown API gateway model: jev-auto` | catalog not republished | `./bin/codex-router refresh-catalog` |
| Jev returns HTTP 422 | request body missing `"model"` | always send `"model": "jev-latest"` to the System One API |
| Native calls fail after a few days | shared session expired | re-run `chatgpt-session enable` |
| `launchctl` rejected inside a supervised agent | environment restriction | use the watchdog; let the user run `install-service.sh` |

## Latency & cost notes

- The current policy is `joint-v2-quality`: the decision backend chooses one of 15 model/effort
  pairs **per turn** — the call that opens a turn (a user message) decides, and
  every continuation of that turn (tool steps, retries, the call that follows a
  mid-turn compaction) reuses that route. A new user ask opens the next turn.
  All tiers use adaptive effort and standard speed; never force
  Luna to max or enable Fast mode.
- Quality is primary. Assess the whole turn's required reasoning and verification;
  do not treat an easy first action as evidence that the whole turn is easy.
  See `ROUTING_POLICY.md` for source provenance and the evaluation procedure.
- No scenario overrides, target model shares, or confidence threshold may
  replace a valid Jev choice with Sol, Luna or Astra. Confidence is diagnostic.
- Provider/schema failures remain distinct: Astra at medium, logged as a
  technical fallback. Kill switch and exhausted-native-quota handling still apply.
- Decision-backend usage and upstream per-attempt tokens are logged when available. Run
  `python3 server/report_routing.py --days 7` for native-only credit estimates;
  unknown usage remains unknown and reasoning tokens are not counted twice.
- `BACKTEST.md` documents the old policy's fixed-token simulation. It is not a
  measurement of current quota savings or result quality.
